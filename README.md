# Morning brief

Daily dashboard for the Polymarket wallet `0x9d4a9ff98bdce01ff8081362f676749db0c85887` (mdorup),
plus a Copenhagen weather line and a Saturn observing forecast for the east balcony.
Live at https://morningbrief.dorup.dk (Vercel project `nothing-ever-happens-book`, team `oxean-x`).

- `python3 refresh.py` fetches Polymarket positions/activity/prices and Open-Meteo forecasts, then writes
  `portfolio.html` and `site/index.html`. It uses only the standard library.
- `research.json` holds "Why it moved" notes, keyed by asset id. The script prints `research MISSING: ...` for
  each position that moved at least 2¢ or $10 without a note for the current 24h window.
- A daily Claude Code cloud routine runs the script, researches the missing movers, reruns it and deploys `site/`
  to Vercel with `VERCEL_TOKEN` from the cloud environment.
